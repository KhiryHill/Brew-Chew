# project1
### Overview
Project 1! This is an important step in our full-stack journey as we are now required to use newly acquired skills and knowledge to build a web application from scratch. 

We conceived and executed a design that solved a real-world problem by integrating data received from two server-side API requests. Along the way and because collaborative work, we learned agile development methodologies and implemented features and bug fixes using the git branch workflow and pull requests.
