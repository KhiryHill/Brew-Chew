# Brew & Chew
### Overview

We conceived and executed a design that solved a real-world problem by integrating data received from two server-side API requests. Along the way and because collaborative work, we learned agile development methodologies and implemented features and bug fixes using the git branch workflow and pull requests.

# What does it do

Our application will offer our user a choice between finding a local restaurant or a brewerie.
After a selection is made you will enter the require login information, which is stored in firebase.
This application makes a call to two APIs to locate restaurants and breweries across North Carolina. 
When the calls made the name, address, phone number and website are rendered on the page.
